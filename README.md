# Orbits

N-body gravity sim with nice graphics (at some point).

## Ideas:

- Different ways of visualising field:
    - Shaders (heatmap etc).
    - Vector field.

- Nice effects (planet trails etc).
- Stars and other bodies.
- Each body has temperature, for planets this is based on radiation recieved by stars.
- Give planets names, and delete by name or by ID.
- Allow user to click planet to view more information about that planet.
- Manipulate time (pause/play/speed).
- Save/Load states.
- Particle effects and debris when planets collide.
- Preview what will happen when adding a planet.
- Good camera.


This branch is for getting the basics down without other bodies other than planets.

IDEA: Middle mouse click for follow with camera.
